1 SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
2 Congress finds that—
3 (1) the United States can take back control of
4 the energy future of the United States, strengthen
5 economic competitiveness, safeguard the health of
6 families and the environment, and ensure the na7
tional security of the United States by increasing en8
ergy independence;
9 (2) creating a clean energy future requires a
10 comprehensive approach that includes support for
11 the improvement of all energy sources, including
12 coal, natural gas, nuclear power, and renewable gen13
eration;
14 (3) efficiency in the energy sector also rep15
resents a critical avenue to reduce energy consump10
O:\END\END10540.xml [file 1 of 7] S.L.C.
1 tion and greenhouse gas, and those benefits can be
2 captured while generating additional savings for con3
sumers;
4 (4) substantially increasing the investment in
5 the clean energy future of the United States will—
6 (A) provide economic opportunities to mil7
lions of people in the United States; and
8 (B) drive future economic growth in the
9 United States;
10 (5) the United States is responsible for many of
11 the initial scientific advances in clean energy tech12
nology but, as of September 2009, the United States
13 has only 5 of the top 30 leading companies in solar,
14 wind, and advanced battery technology;
15 (6) investment in the clean energy sector will
16 allow companies in the United States to retake a
17 leadership position, and the jobs created by those in18
vestments will significantly accelerate growth in do19
mestic manufacturing;
20 (7) those opportunities also will result in sub21
stantial employment gains in construction, a sector
22 in which the median hourly wage is 17 percent high23
er than the national median;
24 (8) those jobs are distributed throughout the
25 United States, and the highest clean energy economy
11
O:\END\END10540.xml [file 1 of 7] S.L.C.
1 employment growth rates in the last 10 years were
2 in the States of Idaho, Nebraska, Oregon, New Mex3
ico, and South Dakota;
4 (9) focusing on clean energy will dramatically
5 reduce pollution and significantly improve the health
6 of families in, and the environment of, the United
7 States;
8 (10) moving to a low-carbon economy must pro9
tect the most vulnerable populations in the United
10 States, including low-income families that are par11
ticularly affected by volatility in energy prices;
12 (11) if unchecked, the impact of climate change
13 will include widespread effects on health and welfare,
14 including—
15 (A) increased outbreaks from waterborne
16 diseases;
17 (B) more droughts;
18 (C) diminished agricultural production;
19 (D) severe storms and floods;
20 (E) heat waves;
21 (F) wildfires; and
22 (G) a substantial rise in sea levels, due in
23 part to—
24 (i) melting mountain glaciers;
25 (ii) shrinking sea ice; and
12
O:\END\END10540.xml [file 1 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (iii) thawing permafrost;
2 (12) the most recent science indicates that the
3 changes described in paragraph (11)(G) are occur4
ring faster and with greater intensity than expected;
5 (13) military officials, including retired admi6
rals and generals, concur with the intelligence com7
munity that climate change—
8 (A) acts as a threat multiplier for insta9
bility; and
10 (B) presents significant national security
11 challenges for the United States;
12 (14) massive portions of the infrastructure of
13 the United States, including critical military infra14
structure, are at risk from the effects of climate
15 change;
16 (15) impacts are already being felt in local com17
munities within the United States, as well as by at18
risk populations abroad;
19 (16) the Copenhagen Accord, which builds on
20 the agreements reached in the Bali Action Plan de21
veloped under the United Nations Framework Con22
vention on Climate Change done at New York on
23 May 19, 1992, recognizes the need to limit the in24
crease in global average temperatures to within 2 de13
O:\END\END10540.xml [file 1 of 7] S.L.C.
1 grees Centigrade as a necessary step to prevent the
2 catastrophic consequences of climate change; and
3 (17) the United States should lead the global
4 community in—
5 (A) combating the threat of global climate
6 change; and
7 (B) reaching a robust international agree8
ment to address climate change under the
9 United Nations Framework Convention on Cli10
mate Change, done at New York on May 9,
11 1992 (or a successor agreement).

1 Subtitle B—Offshore Oil and Gas
2 SEC. 1201. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.
3 (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
4 (1) domestic offshore oil and gas production
5 supports the broader goal of advancing the energy
6 independence of the United States;
7 (2) as the United States accelerates a transition
8 to clean energy sources in response to the incentives
9 and programs established under this Act and the
10 amendments made by this Act, the United States
11 will continue to depend for some time on traditional
12 energy sources to fuel economic and job growth;
13 (3) the catastrophic oil spill in the Gulf of Mex14
ico caused by the explosion of the Deepwater Hori15
zon offshore oil rig tragically illustrates the impera16
tive of moving to clean sources of energy and im17
proving safeguards for domestic production of oil
18 and gas, particularly in offshore areas;
19 (4) the Deepwater Horizon spill has placed local
20 economies, wildlife, and the invaluable coastal eco21
system of the Gulf of Mexico at great risk, and illus22
trates that the coastal and marine resources of the
23 United States are sensitive ecological areas of crit24
ical importance to the economy and environment of
25 the United States;
61
O:\END\END10541.xml [file 2 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (5) a thorough investigation is needed into the
2 cause of the spill and the adequacy of existing safe3
ty, emergency response, and environmental regula4
tions, and lessons learned must be rapidly applied to
5 reduce the risk of, and improve the response to, any
6 future catastrophic spills; and
7 (6) significant financial resources are also need8
ed to repair to the maximum extent practicable dam9
ages to coastal and marine resources resulting from
10 the Deepwater Horizon and other offshore oil spills.
11 (b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act are—
12 (1) to place the United States on a sure path
13 to a cleaner, more secure energy future by estab14
lishing powerful, lasting incentives to develop and
15 deploy fuels and technologies that are produced do16
mestically and reduce significantly the risk of cli17
mate change and other environmental harms that
18 can devastate lives, communities, and livelihoods;
19 and
20 (2) to achieve that purpose, to consider through
21 this Act or accompanying legislation—
22 (A) a moratorium on any new offshore
23 drilling activities until the cause of the explo24
sion of the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig
25 is determined and the Secretary of the Interior
62
O:\END\END10541.xml [file 2 of 7] S.L.C.
1 certifies that it is safe to continue proposed
2 drilling plans;
3 (B) liability mechanisms that ensure ade4
quate funds are available to mitigate the eco5
nomic and environmental impacts of offshore
6 drilling accidents;
7 (C) new precautionary safety measures for
8 ensuring protection for workers and marine eco9
systems;
10 (D) new investments in preparedness, edu11
cation, and training to minimize offshore acci12
dents, as well as acceleration of investments in
13 response capabilities;
14 (E) new studies to assess the effects of oil
15 spill mitigation procedures and tools;
16 (F) determination by coastal States of
17 whether offshore drilling may be permitted off
18 the shorelines of the States and the ability of
19 States to veto proposed drilling plans if the
20 States would suffer significant adverse impacts
21 in the event of an accident;
22 (G) revenue sharing with States that do
23 allow drilling, with the States using the revenue
24 to protect the coastlines and coastal ecosystems
25 of the States, and maintain sufficient prepared63
O:\END\END10541.xml [file 2 of 7] S.L.C.
1 ness capabilities to help respond to any acci2
dent; and
3 (H) investment of additional drilling reve4
nues to support national action to protect and
5 restore oceans and coastal areas.

16 ‘‘Congress finds that—
17 (1) climate change poses a significant threat
18 to the national security, economy, public health and

20 well as of other countries;
21 (2) reviews of scientific studies, including by
22 the National Academy of Sciences and the Intergov23

24 that climate change is the result of the combined an263
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 thropogenic greenhouse gas emissions from numer2
ous sources of all types and sizes;
3 (3) each increment of emission, when com4
bined with other emissions, causes or contributes
5 materially to the acceleration and extent of climate
6 change and the adverse effects of climate change for
7 the lifetime of the gas in the atmosphere;
8 (4) accordingly, controlling emissions in small
9 as well as large quantities is essential to prevent,
10 slow the pace of, reduce the threats from, and miti11
gate climate change and the adverse effects of cli12
mate change;
13 (5) because greenhouse gas emissions induce

17 risk of suffering because of climate change;
18 (7) the fact that some of the adverse and po19

25 collectively may, in accordance with this
332
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 paragraph, use offset credits to dem2
onstrate compliance for up to a maximum
3 of 2,000,000,000 tons of greenhouse gas
4 emissions annually.
5 (ii) DEMONSTRATION OF COMPLI6
ANCE.—In any calendar year, a covered
7 entity (other than a covered entity de8
scribed in section 700(12)(B)) may dem9
onstrate compliance by holding 1 domestic
10 offset credit or 1.25 international offset
11 credits in lieu of an emission allowance, ex12
cept as provided in subparagraph (C), for
13 up to the maximum number of tons of
14 greenhouse gas emissions (including attrib15
utable greenhouse gas emissions) described
16 in subparagraph (B).
17 (B) MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TONS OF
18 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.—
19 (i) IN GENERAL.—Except as pro20
vided in clause (ii), the regulations promul21
gated under section 730 shall require the
22 maximum number of tons of greenhouse
23 gas emissions referred to in subparagraph
24 (A) for which a covered entity (other than
25 a covered entity described in section
333
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 700(12)(B)) may use offset credits to dem2
onstrate compliance in a given calendar
3 year to be determined by—
4 (I) dividing—
5 (aa) the tons of carbon di6
oxide equivalent of greenhouse
7 gas emissions for which the cov8
ered entity demonstrated compli9
ance under this section in the
10 year before the preceding cal11
endar year, or would have been
12 required to demonstrate compli13
ance if the requirements of this
14 title for the given year had been
15 in effect for the year before the
16 preceding calendar year, which17
ever tonnage number is greater;
18 by
19 (bb) the sum of the tons of
20 carbon dioxide equivalent of
21 greenhouse gas emissions for
22 which all covered entities (other
23 than covered entities described in
24 section 700(12)(B)) dem25
onstrated compliance in the year
334
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 before the preceding calendar
2 year, or would have been required
3 to demonstrate compliance if the
4 requirements of this title for the
5 given year had been in effect for
6 the year before the preceding cal7
endar, whichever tonnage number
8 is greater; and
9 (II) multiplying the quotient ob10
tained under subclause (I) by
11 2,000,000,000.
12 (ii) ADJUSTMENT FOR NEW EN13
TRANTS.—In the regulations promulgated
14 under section 730, the Administrator
15 shall—
16 (I) establish a maximum num17
ber of tons of greenhouse gas emis18
sions for which a covered entity that
19 commences operation after 2012 may
20 use offset credits to demonstrate com21
pliance; and
22 (II) adjust the calculation under
23 clause (i) to ensure that offset credits
24 may not be used to demonstrate com25
pliance for more than 2,000,000,000
335
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 tons of greenhouse gas emissions in
2 any given year.
3 (iii) APPORTIONMENT BETWEEN DO4
MESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL OFFSET
5 CREDITS.—
6 (I) IN GENERAL.—Except as
7 provided in subclause (II), no covered
8 entity may use international offset
9 credits to demonstrate compliance for
10 more than 25 percent of the max11
imum number of tons of greenhouse
12 gas emissions described in subpara13
graph (A) in any given year.
14 (II) ADJUSTMENT.—If the Ad15
ministrator determines that domestic
16 offset credits available for use in dem17
onstrating compliance in any calendar
18 year at domestic offset prices gen19
erally equal to or less than allowance
20 prices are likely to offset less than
21 1,500,000,000 tons of greenhouse gas
22 emissions, the Administrator shall in23
crease the percent of emissions for
24 which international offset credits may
25 be used to demonstrate compliance to
336
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 reflect the quantity that
2 1,500,000,000 exceeds the number of
3 domestic offset credits the Adminis4
trator determines is available for that
5 year, allowing covered entities collec6
tively to use international offset cred7
its to demonstrate compliance for up
8 to a maximum of 1,000,000,000 tons
9 of greenhouse gas emissions.
10 (C) INTERNATIONAL OFFSET CREDITS.—
11 Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), to dem12
onstrate compliance prior to calendar year
13 2018, a covered entity may use 1 international
14 offset credit in lieu of an emission allowance up
15 to the quantity permitted under this paragraph.
16 (D) PRESIDENT’S RECOMMENDATION.—
17 The President may make a recommendation to
18 Congress as to whether the number
19 2,000,000,000 specified in subparagraphs (A)
20 and (B) should be increased or decreased.
21 (2) INTERNATIONAL EMISSION ALLOW22
ANCES.—To demonstrate compliance, a covered enti23
ty may hold an international emission allowance in
24 lieu of an emission allowance.
337
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (3) COMPENSATORY ALLOWANCES.—To dem2
onstrate compliance, a covered entity may hold a
3 compensatory allowance obtained under subsection

ance.
6 (e) RETIREMENT OF ALLOWANCES AND CREDITS.—
7 As soon as practicable after a deadline established for cov8
ered entities to demonstrate compliance with this title, the
9 Administrator shall retire the quantity of allowances or
10 credits required to be held under this title.
11 (f) ALTERNATIVE METRICS.—For categories of cov12
ered entities described in subparagraph (C), (D), (G), (H),
13 or (I) of section 700(12), the Administrator may, by rule,
14 establish an applicability threshold for inclusion under
15 those subparagraphs using an alternative metric and level,
16 if the metric and level are easier to administer and cover
17 the same size and type of sources as the threshold estab18
lished under those subparagraphs.
19 (g) THRESHOLD REVIEW.—
20 (1) IN GENERAL.—For each category of cov21
ered entities described in subparagraph (B), (C),
22 (D), (G), (H), or (I) of section 700(12), the Admin23
istrator shall, in 2020 and once every 8 years there24
after, review the carbon dioxide equivalent emission
25 thresholds that are used to define covered entities.
338
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (2) LOWERING OF THRESHOLD.—The Admin2
istrator may by rule lower the threshold described in
3 paragraph (1) to not less than 10,000 tons of car4
bon dioxide equivalent emissions after consideration
5 of—
6 (A) emissions from covered entities in
7 each such category, and from other entities of
8 the same type that emit less than the threshold
9 quantity for the category (including emission
10 sources that commence operation after the date
11 of enactment of this title that are not covered
12 entities); and
13 (B) whether greater greenhouse gas emis14
sion reductions can be cost-effectively achieved
15 by lowering the applicable threshold.
16 (3) COST EFFECTIVENESS.—In determining
17 the cost effectiveness of potential reductions from
18 lowering the threshold for covered entities, the Ad19
ministrator shall consider alternative regulatory
20 greenhouse gas programs, including setting stand21
ards under other titles of this Act.
22 (h) DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVES.—The regula23
tions promulgated under section 730 shall require that
24 each covered entity, and each entity holding allowances or
339
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 credits or receiving allowances or credits from the Admin2
istrator under this title, select a designated representative.
3 (i) EDUCATION AND OUTREACH.—
4 (1) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall es5
tablish and carry out a program of education and
6 outreach to assist covered entities, especially entities
7 having little experience with environmental regu8
latory requirements similar or comparable to the re9
quirements of this title, in preparing to meet the
10 compliance obligations of this title.
11 (2) USE OF MARKETS.—The program shall in12
clude education with respect to using markets to ef13
fectively achieve compliance to the extent appro14
priate for the covered entity.
15 (3) FAILURE TO RECEIVE INFORMATION.—A
16 failure to receive information or assistance under
17 this subsection may not be used as a defense against
18 an allegation of any violation of this title.
19 (j) ADJUSTMENT OF DEADLINE.—The Adminis20
trator may, by rule, establish a deadline for demonstrating
21 compliance, for a calendar year, that is later than the date
22 provided in subsection (a), as necessary to ensure the
23 availability of emission data, but in no event shall the
24 deadline be later than June 1.

10 comply with any law (including any regulation,
11 consent order, or consent agreement, but ex12
cluding any contract);
13 (B) were not commenced prior to Janu14
ary 1, 2009, except in the case of offset project
15 activities that commenced after January 1,
16 2001, and were registered as of the date of en17
actment of this title under an offset program
18 with respect to which the Administrator has
19 made an affirmative determination under sec20
tion 740(b)(2);
21 (C) are not receiving support under this
22 Act; and
23 (D) exceed the activity baseline estab24
lished under paragraph (2);
437
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (2) a standardized methodology for estab2
lishing activity baselines for offset projects of that
3 type, including an activity baseline established by
4 the Administrator to reflect a conservative estimate
5 of business-as-usual performance or practices for the
6 relevant type of activity such that the baseline pro7
vides an adequate margin of safety to ensure the en8
vironmental integrity of offsets calculated in ref9
erence to the baseline;
10 (3) a standardized methodology for use in de11
termining the extent to which emission reductions
12 achieved by an offset project of that type exceed a

14 monitoring and accounting for uncertainty; and
15 (4) a standardized methodology for use in ac16
counting for and mitigating potential leakage, if any,
17 from an offset project of that type, taking uncer18
tainty into account.
19 (b) ACCOUNTING FOR REVERSALS.—
20 (1) REGULATIONS.—As part of the regulations
21 promulgated under section 753(a), for each type of
22 sequestration project listed under section 754, the
23 Administrator shall establish requirements to ac24
count for and address reversals, including—
438
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (A) a requirement to report any reversal
2 with respect to an offset project for which offset
3 credits have been issued under this part;
4 (B) provisions to require emission allow5
ances or offset credits to be held in quantities
6 to fully compensate for greenhouse gas emis7
sions attributable to reversals, and to assign re8
sponsibility for holding the emission allowances
9 or offset credits;
10 (C) provisions to discourage repeated in11
tentional reversals by offset project representa12
tives, including the assessment of administra13
tive fees, temporary suspension, or disqualifica14
tion of an offset project representative from the
15 program; and
16 (D) any other provisions the Adminis17
trator determines to be necessary to account for
18 and address reversals.
19 (2) MECHANISMS.—
20 (A) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator
21 shall prescribe mechanisms to ensure that—
22 (i) any sequestration with respect to
23 which an offset credit is issued under this
24 part results in a net increase in sequestra25
tion (ensuring the offset credit is equiva439
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 lent to an emission allowance in terms of
2 atmospheric impact over time); and
3 (ii) full account is taken of any ac4
tual or potential reversal of such seques5
tration, with an adequate margin of safety.
6 (B) REQUIREMENTS.—The Administrator
7 shall prescribe at least 1 of the following mech8
anisms to meet the requirements of this para9
graph:
10 (i) An offsets reserve, pursuant to
11 section 734(b)(2) (but not subject to sec12
tion 734(b)(2)(B)(iii)(III)).
13 (ii) Insurance that provides for pur14
chase and provision to the Administrator
15 for retirement of a quantity of offset cred16
its or emission allowances equal in number
17 to the tons of carbon dioxide equivalents of
18 greenhouse gas emissions released due to
19 reversal.
20 (iii) Another mechanism that the Ad21
ministrator determines satisfies the re22
quirements of this part.
23 (c) CREDITING PERIODS.—As part of the regula24
tions promulgated under section 753(a), for each offset
25 project type, the Administrator shall specify a crediting
440
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 period, and establish provisions for petitions for new cred2
iting periods, as provided in section 734(c), except that—
3 (1) the crediting period for a forestry offset
4 project shall not exceed 20 years; and
5 (2) the Administrator shall make the petition
6 available publicly on the Internet prior to granting
7 a petition for a new crediting period.
8 (d) EMISSION REDUCTION INTEGRITY AND PRE9
EXISTING METHODOLOGIES.—In establishing the require10
ments under this section, the Administrator shall meet the
11 requirements of subsections (d), (e), and (g) of section
12 735.
13 (e) ADDED PROJECT TYPES.—The Administrator
14 shall establish methodologies described in subsection (a),
15 and, as applicable, requirements and mechanisms for re16
versals as described in subsection (b), for any project type
17 that is added to the list pursuant to section 754.
18 (f) MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS.—In promul19
gating regulations under section 753(a) governing the
20 issuance of international offset credits pursuant to section
21 756, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary
22 of State and the Administrator of the United States Agen23
cy for International Development, may modify or omit a
24 requirement of section 754, 755, or 757 if the Adminis25
trator determines that—
441
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (1) the application of that requirement in the
2 context of 1 of the categories listed under section
3 756 is not feasible; or would result in the creation
4 of offset credits that would not be eligible to satisfy
5 emission reduction commitments made by the United
6 States pursuant to the United Nations Framework
7 Convention on Climate Change, done at New York
8 on May 9, 1992 (or any successor agreement); and
9 (2) such modification or omission would not
10 affect, as determined by the Administrator with an
11 adequate margin of safety, the integrity of inter12
national offset credits and of the greenhouse gas
13 emission limitations established pursuant to section
14 703.
15 (g) AVOIDING DOUBLE COUNTING.—The Adminis16
trator, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall
17 seek, by whatever means appropriate, including agree18
ments, arrangements, or technical cooperation, to ensure
19 that activities on the basis of which international offset
20 credits are issued under this section are not used for com21
pliance with an obligation to reduce or avoid greenhouse
22 gas emissions, or increase greenhouse gas sequestration,
23 under a foreign or international regulatory system.
442
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (h) LIMITATION.—The Administrator shall not issue
2 international offset credits generated by projects based on
3 the destruction of hydrofluorocarbons.

ITS.
6 (a) SECTOR-BASED CREDITS.—
7 (1) DEFINITION OF SECTORAL BASIS.—
8 (A) IN GENERAL.—In this subsection, the
9 term ‘sectoral basis’ means the issuance of
10 international offset credits only for the quantity
11 of sector-wide emission reductions achieved
12 across the relevant sector or sectors of the econ13
omy relative to a baseline level of emissions es14
tablished in an agreement or arrangement de15
scribed in section 753(c) for the sector.
16 (B) BASELINE.—The baseline level of
17 emissions for a sector referred to in subpara18
graph (A) shall—
19 (i) be established at levels of green20
house gas emissions lower than would
21 occur under a business-as-usual scenario,
22 taking into account relevant domestic or
23 international policies or incentives to re24
duce greenhouse gas emissions;
443
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (ii) be used to determine
2 additionality and performance;
3 (iii) account for all significant
4 sources of emissions from a sector;
5 (iv) be adjusted over time to reflect
6 changing circumstances;
7 (v) be developed taking into consid8
eration such factors as—
9 (I) any established emission
10 performance level for the sector;
11 (II) the current performance of
12 the sector in the country;
13 (III) expected future trends of
14 the sector in the country; and
15 (IV) historical data and other
16 factors to ensure additionality; and
17 (vi) be designed to produce signifi18
cant deviations from business-as-usual
19 emissions, consistent with nationally appro20
priate mitigation commitments or actions,
21 in a way that equitably contributes to
22 meeting thresholds identified in section
23 705(e)(2).
24 (2) ACTION BY ADMINISTRATOR.—To mini25
mize the potential for leakage and to encourage
444
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 countries to take nationally appropriate mitigation
2 actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions,
3 or sequester greenhouse gases, the Administrator, in
4 consultation with the Secretary of State and the Ad5
ministrator of the United States Agency for Inter6
national Development, shall—
7 (A) identify sectors, or combinations of
8 sectors, within specific countries with respect to
9 which the issuance of international offset cred10
its on a sectoral basis is appropriate; and
11 (B) issue international offset credits for
12 those sectors only on a sectoral basis.
13 (3) IDENTIFICATION OF SECTORS.—
14 (A) IN GENERAL.—For purposes of para15
graph (2)(A), a sectoral basis shall be appro16
priate for activities—
17 (i) in countries that have compara18
tively high greenhouse gas emissions, or
19 comparatively greater levels of economic
20 development; and
21 (ii) that, if located in the United
22 States, would be within a sector subject to
23 the compliance obligation under section
24 722.
445
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (B) FACTORS.—In determining the sec2
tors and countries for which international offset
3 credits should be awarded only on a sectoral
4 basis, the Administrator, in consultation with
5 the Secretary of State and the Administrator of
6 the United States Agency for International De7
velopment, shall consider the following factors:
8 (i) The gross domestic product of the
9 country.
10 (ii) The total greenhouse gas emis11
sions of the country.
12 (iii) Whether the comparable sector
13 of the United States economy is covered by
14 the compliance obligation under section
15 722.
16 (iv) The heterogeneity or homo17
geneity of sources within the relevant sec18
tor.
19 (v) Whether the relevant sector pro20
vides products or services that are sold in
21 internationally competitive markets.
22 (vi) The risk of leakage if inter23
national offset credits were issued on a
24 project-level basis, instead of on a sectoral
446
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 basis, for activities within the relevant sec2
tor.
3 (vii) The capability of accurately
4 measuring, monitoring, reporting, and
5 verifying the performance of sources across
6 the relevant sector.
7 (viii) Such other factors as the Ad8
ministrator, in consultation with the Sec9
retary of State and the Administrator of
10 the United States Agency for International
11 Development, determines are appro12
priate—
13 (I) to ensure the integrity of the
14 United States greenhouse gas emis15
sion limitations established under sec16
tion 703; and
17 (II) to encourage countries to
18 take nationally appropriate mitigation
19 actions to reduce emissions.
20 (ix) The issuance of offsets for ac21
tivities that are—
22 (I) in addition to nationally ap23
propriate mitigation actions taken by
24 developing countries pursuant to the
447
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 low-carbon development plans of the
2 countries; and
3 (II) on a sectoral basis.
4 (b) CREDITS ISSUED BY AN INTERNATIONAL
5 BODY.—
6 (1) ISSUANCE OF CREDITS.—
7 (A) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator, in
8 consultation with the Secretary of State, may
9 issue international offset credits in exchange for
10 instruments in the nature of offset credits that
11 are issued by an international body established
12 pursuant to—
13 (i) the United Nations Framework
14 Convention on Climate Change, done at
15 New York on May 9, 1992;

17 PART III—INTERNATIONAL METHANE
18 SEC. 2221. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON INTERNATIONAL
19 METHANE.
20 (a) FINDINGS.—The Senate finds that—
21 (1) methane is recognized by the Intergovern22
mental Panel on Climate Change as the second lead23
ing contributor to climate change among greenhouse
24 gases;
614
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (2) methane is emitted from both natural and
2 anthropogenic sources, with the latter representing
3 over 60 percent of global emissions;
4 (3) methane is more than 20 times more effec5
tive at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon
6 dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas responsible for
7 climate change;
8 (4) methane contributes to the formation of
9 ground-level ozone, which is known to be hazardous
10 to public health and is also known to contribute sig11
nificantly to climate change;
12 (5) methane typically remains in the atmos13
phere for the relatively short period of 10 to 12
14 years, meaning that reducing emissions can reduce
15 the harmful impacts of methane in a comparably
16 short period of time, therefore making methane a
17 promising target for climate mitigation measures
18 seeking near-term benefits;
19 (6) the various near-term benefits from pre20
venting and reducing methane emissions include pro21
tection of vulnerable regions and climate elements
22 such as the Arctic, northern permafrost, ice sheets
23 and alpine glaciers;
615
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (7) protection of such regions and elements is
2 a key means of preventing potentially dangerous cli3
mate feedbacks;
4 (8) anthropogenic methane emissions result pri5
marily from agricultural activities, landfills, oil and
6 natural gas systems, coal mines, wastewater treat7
ment, and mobile and stationary combustion;
8 (9) it is technically and economically feasible to
9 prevent methane emissions or capture methane and
10 reuse the methane for energy purposes, thereby re11
ducing the climate impacts of methane as well as
12 smog pollution; and
13 (10) the United States has initiated and led the
14 international Methane to Markets Partnership, fo15
cusing on cost-effective, near-term methane recovery
16 from underground coal mines, landfills, natural gas
17 and oil systems, wastewater treatment, and animal
18 waste management.
19 (b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense of the
20 Senate that the United States should redouble efforts to
21 maximize the cost-effective energy, economic, environ22
mental, and public health benefits of preventing and recov23
ering anthropogenic methane emissions, including—
616
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (1) expanding the involvement of the United
2 States with and sponsorship of the Methane to Mar3
kets Partnership, including efforts—
4 (A) to involve new country partners;
5 (B) to scale up successful efforts to ad6
dress methane emissions; and
7 (C) to research additional methods for pre8
venting and capturing methane emissions from
9 existing sources and sources not yet addressed;
10 (2) working with developed and developing
11 countries to raise awareness of options and cobene12
fits and to enhance the efforts of the countries to re13
duce methane emissions as a means of securing—
14 (A) economic growth;
15 (B) access to energy;
16 (C) improved air and water quality;
17 (D) enhanced industrial safety; and
18 (E) reduced climate impacts, including de19
velopment of national methane action plans;
20 (3) broadening the cooperation of the United
21 States with the private sector in efforts to reduce
22 emissions through improved management practices
23 and use and deployment of cost-effective tech24
nologies; and
617
O:\END\END10542.xml [file 3 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (4) cooperating with the World Bank, regional

19 Act, the Administrator, in consultation with the
20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shall
21 conduct a study to determine whether the allo22
cation formula under paragraph (3) results
23 in—
24 (i) windfall profits to merchant coal
25 generators; or
721
O:\END\END10543.xml [file 4 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (ii) substantially disparate treatment
2 of merchant coal generators operating in

24 (B) PRO RATA DISTRIBUTION.—If the
25 quantity of emission allowances that would oth722
O:\END\END10543.xml [file 4 of 7] S.L.C.
1 erwise be distributed pursuant to paragraph (4)
2 or (5) for any vintage year would exceed the
3 limitation described in subparagraph (A), the
4 Administrator shall distribute 10 percent of the
5 total quantity of emission allowances available
6 for distribution under section 781(a)(1) for the
7 relevant vintage year on a pro rata basis among
8 merchant coal generators based on the applica9
ble formula under paragraph (4) or (5).

16 (8) COMPETITIVE EFFECTS.—If the Adminis17
trator determines that, in any State that has adopt18
ed retail electricity competition without requiring
19 separation of ownership of generation from elec20
tricity distribution, the distribution of allowances to
21 merchant coal units is likely to adversely affect com22
petition between generation provided by merchant
23 coal units and generation provided by entities that
24 own both distribution and generation, the Adminis25
trator may, to the extent necessary to address the
723
O:\END\END10543.xml [file 4 of 7] S.L.C.
1 adverse competitive effects, treat coal-fueled units in
2 that State as merchant coal units even if the coal3

14 emitted as a result of a qualifying electricity
15 sales agreement referred to in subsection
16 (a)(10)(B)(i); and
17 (B) the incremental number of tons of
18 carbon dioxide emitted solely as a result of a
19 qualifying thermal sales agreement referred to
20 in subsection (a)(10)(B)(ii), subject to the con21
dition that the Administrator shall not dis22
tribute more than 1 emission allowance for the
23 same ton of emissions.
24 (2) LIMITATION ON ALLOWANCES.—
724
O:\END\END10543.xml [file 4 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (A) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding para2

trator shall distribute under this subsection not
4 more than 4.3 percent of the total quantity of
5 emission allowances available for the vintage
6 year for distribution to the electricity sector
7 under section 781(a)(1).
8 (B) FUTURE VINTAGE YEAR ALLOW9
ANCES.—
10 (i) IN GENERAL.—To the extent that
11 any quantity of emission allowances that
12 would otherwise be distributed pursuant to
13 paragraph (1) would exceed 4.3 percent for
14 any vintage year, the Administrator shall
15 distribute future vintage year emission al16
lowances reserved for long-term contract
17 generators under this section to satisfy the
18 shortfall, subject to projections by the Ad19
ministrator of required emission allowance
20 needs for long-term contract generators
21 during future vintage years.

2 to those emission allowances.
3 (C) SHORTFALL.—If the quantity of
4 emission allowances that would otherwise be
5 distributed pursuant to paragraph (1) for any
6 vintage year would result in a shortfall based on
7 a consideration of available emission allowances
8 under this subsection over the entire allocation
9 period, as determined by the Administrator, the
10 Administrator shall distribute the emission al11
lowances available for distribution under section
12 781(a)(1) for that vintage year on a pro rata
13 basis among long-term contract generators in
14 accordance with paragraph (1).

11 TITLE V—INTERNATIONAL
12 CLIMATE CHANGE ACTIVITIES
13 SEC. 5001. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
14 It is the policy of the United States to—
15 (1) recognize that global climate change—
16 (A) is a potentially significant national and
17 global security threat multiplier;
18 (B) is likely to exacerbate competition and
19 conflict over agricultural, vegetative, marine,
20 and water resources; and
21 (C) will likely result in increased displace22
ment of people, poverty, and hunger within de23
veloping countries;
894
O:\END\END10545.xml [file 6 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (2) protect Americans from the impacts of cli2
mate change through global reductions in green3
house gas emissions;
4 (3) address the strategic, social, political, eco5
nomic, cultural, and environmental consequences of
6 global climate change that are likely to have dis7
proportionate adverse impacts on developing coun8
tries, which—
9 (A) have less economic capacity to respond
10 to such impacts; and
11 (B) are likely to pose long-term challenges
12 to the national security, foreign policy, and eco13
nomic interests of the United States;
14 (4) recognize the significant contributions of
15 women in their communities and secure their in16
volvement as primary stakeholders;
17 (5) take measures to address emissions from,
18 and drivers of, deforestation as part of a global ef19
fort to mitigate climate change;
20 (6) recognize that it is in the national interest
21 of the United States to assist developing countries to
22 reduce and ultimately halt emissions from deforest23
ation in a manner consistent with preserving the
24 rights and securing the involvement of indigenous
25 peoples and forest-dependent communities, since—
895
O:\END\END10545.xml [file 6 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (A) as primary stakeholders, indigenous
2 peoples and forest-dependent communities are
3 critical partners in efforts to reduce deforest4
ation and degradation; and
5 (B) the participation and buy-in regarding
6 related activities of such peoples and commu7
nities is vital to the success, sustainability, and
8 permanence of emission reductions;
9 (7) support the export deployment of clean en10
ergy technologies through bilateral and multilateral
11 financing mechanisms, since—
12 (A) many developing countries lack the fi13
nancial and technical resources to adopt clean
14 energy technologies;
15 (B) absent international support, the
16 greenhouse gas emissions of such countries
17 could continue to increase;
18 (C) investments in, and the deployment of,
19 clean technology in developing countries could—
20 (i) be cost-effective;
21 (ii) enhance economic opportunities
22 for the United States;
23 (iii) increase the demand for clean en24
ergy products;
25 (iv) lower costs; and
896
O:\END\END10545.xml [file 6 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (v) result in global greenhouse gas
2 emissions reductions;
3 (D) intellectual property rights are a key
4 driver of investment and research and develop5
ment in, and the global deployment of, clean
6 technologies;
7 (E) coordinated financial assistance from
8 the United States could help catalyze and assist
9 developing countries to adopt low-carbon and
10 development pathways;
11 (8) provide assistance to developing countries
12 with varying climate change adaptation and resil13
ience needs among different communities and popu14
lations, including impoverished communities, chil15
dren, women, and indigenous peoples, since—
16 (A) countries most vulnerable to climate
17 change, due to greater exposure to harmful im18
pacts and lower capacity to adapt, are devel19
oping countries with very low industrial green20
house gas emissions that have contributed less
21 to climate change than more affluent countries;
22 (B) to a much greater degree than devel23
oped countries, developing countries rely on the
24 natural ecosystems likely to be affected by cli897
O:\END\END10545.xml [file 6 of 7] S.L.C.
1 mate change for sustenance, livelihoods, and
2 economic growth and stability;
3 (C) many developing countries will face
4 sharply decreasing yields from agriculture pro5
duction because of climate change, which will—
6 (i) undermine food security;
7 (ii) necessitate substantial additional
8 support for agricultural development and
9 emergency response to food insecurity; and
10 (iii) necessitate major shifts in pro11
duction techniques to raise yields through
12 low-input, sustainable, and biodiverse
13 methods;
14 (9) provide predictable, stable, and sufficient fi15
nancing to—
16 (A) support global climate change goals;
17 and
18 (B) leverage private financing mechanisms;
19 (10) engage in bilateral and multilateral ap20
proaches to make progress towards securing global
21 participation and action to—
22 (A) mitigate greenhouse gas emissions;
23 (B) adapt to the impacts of climate
24 change, including enhanced agricultural produc25
tivity and soil resilience;
898
O:\END\END10545.xml [file 6 of 7] S.L.C.
1 (C) reduce emissions from deforestation
2 and forest degradation; and
3 (D) provide the necessary financing to ac4
complish these objectives; and
5 (11) recognize the strengths of the United Na6
tions Framework Convention on Climate Change as
7 a primary forum for agreement on global climate
8 change.
