1 SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
2 Congress finds that—
3 (1) the United States can take back control of
4 the energy future of the United States, strengthen
5 economic competitiveness, safeguard the health of
6 families and the environment, and ensure the na7
tional security, of the United States by increasing
8 energy independence;
9 (2) creating a clean energy future requires a
10 comprehensive approach that includes support for
11 the improvement of all energy sources, including
8
O:\DEC\DEC09780.xml [file 1 of 5] S.L.C.
1 coal, natural gas, nuclear power, and renewable gen2
eration;
3 (3) efficiency in the energy sector also rep4
resents a critical avenue to reduce energy consump5
tion and carbon pollution, and those benefits can be
6 captured while generating additional savings for con7
sumers;
8 (4) substantially increasing the investment in
9 the clean energy future of the United States will
10 provide economic opportunities to millions of people
11 in the United States and drive future economic
12 growth in this country;
13 (5) the United States is responsible for many of
14 the initial scientific advances in clean energy tech15
nology, but, as of September 2009, the United
16 States has only 5 of the top 30 leading companies
17 in solar, wind, and advanced battery technology;
18 (6) investment in the clean energy sector will
19 allow companies in the United States to retake a
20 leadership position, and the jobs created by those in21
vestments will significantly accelerate growth in do22
mestic manufacturing;
23 (7) those opportunities also will result in sub24
stantial employment gains in construction, a sector
9
O:\DEC\DEC09780.xml [file 1 of 5] S.L.C.
1 in which the median hourly wage is 17 percent high2
er than the national median;
3 (8) those jobs are distributed throughout the
4 United States, and the highest clean energy economy
5 employment growth rates in the last 10 years were
6 in the States of Idaho, Nebraska, South Dakota, Or7
egon, and New Mexico;
8 (9) focusing on clean energy will dramatically
9 reduce pollution and significantly improve the health
10 of families in and the environment of the United
11 States;
12 (10) moving to a low-carbon economy must pro13
tect the most vulnerable populations in the United
14 States, including low-income families that are par15
ticularly affected by volatility in energy prices;
16 (11) if unchecked, the impact of climate change
17 will include widespread effects on health and welfare,
18 including—
19 (A) increased outbreaks from waterborne
20 diseases;
21 (B) more droughts;
22 (C) diminished agricultural production;
23 (D) severe storms and floods;
24 (E) heat waves;
25 (F) wildfires; and
10
O:\DEC\DEC09780.xml [file 1 of 5] S.L.C.
1 (G) a substantial rise in sea levels, due in
2 part to—
3 (i) melting mountain glaciers;
4 (ii) shrinking sea ice; and
5 (iii) thawing permafrost;
6 (12) the most recent science indicates that the
7 changes described in paragraph (11)(G) are occur8
ring faster and with greater intensity than expected;
9 (13) military officials, including retired admi10
rals and generals, concur with the intelligence com11
munity that climate change acts as a threat multi12
plier for instability and presents significant national
13 security challenges for the United States;
14 (14) massive portions of the infrastructure of
15 the United States, including critical military infra16
structure, are at risk from the effects of climate
17 change;
18 (15) impacts are already being felt in local com19
munities within the United States as well as by at20
risk populations abroad;
21 (16) the Declaration of the Leaders from the
22 Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate,
23 representing 17 of the largest economies in the
24 world, recognizes the need to limit the increase in
25 global average temperatures to within 2 degrees
11
O:\DEC\DEC09780.xml [file 1 of 5] S.L.C.
1 Centigrade, as a necessary step to prevent the cata2
strophic consequences of climate change; and
3 (17) the United States should lead the global
4 community in combating the threat of global climate
5 change and reaching a robust international agree6
ment to address global warming under the United
7 Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,
8 done at New York on May 9, 1992 (or a successor
9 agreement).
10 SEC. 3. ECONOMYWIDE EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS.
11 The goals of this Act and the amendments made by
12 this Act are to reduce steadily the quantity of United
13 States greenhouse gas emissions such that—
14 (1) in 2012, the quantity of United States
15 greenhouse gas emissions does not exceed 97 percent
16 of the quantity of United States greenhouse gas
17 emissions in 2005;
18 (2) in 2020, the quantity of United States
19 greenhouse gas emissions does not exceed 80 percent
20 of the quantity of United States greenhouse gas
21 emissions in 2005;
22 (3) in 2030, the quantity of United States
23 greenhouse gas emissions does not exceed 58 percent
24 of the quantity of United States greenhouse gas
25 emissions in 2005; and
12
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 (4) in 2050, the quantity of United States

13 date of enactment of this Act.
14 (f) DETERMINATION OF FOSSIL FUEL-BASED ELEC15
TRICITY DELIVERIES.—
16 (1) FINDINGS.—The Congress finds that:
17 (A) The assessments under subsection (d)
18 are to be collected based on the amount of fossil
19 fuel-based electricity delivered by each distribu20
tion utility.
21 (B) Since many distribution utilities pur22
chase all or part of their retail consumer’s elec23
tricity needs from other entities, it may not be
24 practical to determine the precise fuel mix for
120
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 the power sold by each individual distribution
2 utility.
3 (C) It may be necessary to use average
4 data, often on a regional basis with reference to
5 Regional Transmission Organization (‘‘RTO’’)
6 or NERC regions, to make the determinations
7 necessary for making assessments.
8 (2) DOE PROPOSED RULE.—The Secretary,
9 acting in close consultation with the Energy Infor10
mation Administration, shall issue for notice and
11 comment a proposed rule to determine the level of
12 fossil fuel electricity delivered to retail customers by
13 each distribution utility in the United States during
14 the most recent calendar year or other period deter15
mined to be most appropriate. Such proposed rule
16 shall balance the need to be efficient, reasonably pre17
cise, and timely, taking into account the nature and
18 cost of data currently available and the nature of
19 markets and regulation in effect in various regions
20 of the country. Different methodologies may be ap21
plied in different regions if appropriate to obtain the
22 best balance of such factors.
23 (3) FINAL RULE.—Within 6 months after the
24 date of enactment of this Act, and after opportunity
25 for comment, the Secretary shall issue a final rule
121
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 under this subsection for determining the level and
2 type of fossil fuel-based electricity delivered to retail
3 customers by each distribution utility in the United
4 States during the appropriate period. In issuing
5 such rule, the Secretary may consider opportunities
6 and costs to develop new data sources in the future
7 and issue recommendations for the Energy Informa8
tion Administration or other entities to collect such
9 data. After notice and opportunity for comment the
10 Secretary may, by rule, subsequently update and
11 modify the methodology for making such determina12
tions.
13 (4) ANNUAL DETERMINATIONS.—Pursuant to
14 the final rule issued under paragraph (3), the Sec15
retary shall make annual determinations of the
16 amounts and types for each such utility and publish
17 such determinations in the Federal Register. Such
18 determinations shall be used to conduct the ref19
erendum under subsection (b) and by the Corpora20
tion in applying any assessment under this sub21
section.
22 (5) REHEARING AND JUDICIAL REVIEW.—The
23 owner or operator of any distribution utility that be24
lieves that the Secretary has misapplied the method25
ology in the final rule in determining the amount
122
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 and types of fossil fuel electricity delivered by such
2 distribution utility may seek rehearing of such deter3
mination within 30 days of publication of the deter4
mination in the Federal Register. The Secretary
5 shall decide such rehearing petitions within 30 days.
6 The Secretary’s determinations following rehearing
7 shall be final and subject to judicial review in the
8 United States Court of Appeals for the District of
9 Columbia.
10 (g) COMPLIANCE WITH CORPORATION ASSESS11
MENTS.—The Corporation may bring an action in the ap12
propriate court of the United States to compel compliance
13 with an assessment levied by the Corporation under this
14 section. A successful action for compliance under this sub15
section may also require payment by the defendant of the
16 costs incurred by the Corporation in bringing such action.
17 (h) MIDCOURSE REVIEW.—Not later than 5 years
18 following establishment of the Corporation, the Comp19
troller General of the United States shall prepare an anal20
ysis, and report to Congress, assessing the Corporation’s
21 activities, including project selection and methods of dis22
bursement of assessed fees, impacts on the prospects for
23 commercialization of carbon capture and storage tech24
nologies, adequacy of funding, and administration of
25 funds. The report shall also make such recommendations
123
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 as may be appropriate in each of these areas. The Cor2
poration shall reimburse the Government Accountability
3 Office for the costs associated with performing this mid4
course review.
5 (i) RECOVERY OF COSTS.—
6 (1) IN GENERAL.—A distribution utility whose
7 transmission, delivery, or sales of electric energy are
8 subject to any form of rate regulation shall not be
9 denied the opportunity to recover the full amount of
10 the prudently incurred costs associated with com11
plying with this section, consistent with applicable
12 State or Federal law.
13 (2) RATEPAYER REBATES.—Regulatory authori14
ties that approve cost recovery pursuant to para15
graph (1) may order rebates to ratepayers to the ex16

8 Subtitle C—Nuclear and Advanced
9 Technologies
10 SEC. 131. FINDINGS AND POLICY.
11 (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
12 (1) in 2008, 104 nuclear power plants produced
13 19.6 percent of the electricity generated in the
14 United States, slightly less than the electricity gen15
erated by natural gas;
16 (2) nuclear energy is the largest provider of
17 clean, low-carbon, electricity, almost 8 times larger
18 than all renewable power production combined, ex19
cluding hydroelectric power;
20 (3) nuclear energy supplies consistent, base-load
21 electricity, independent of environmental conditions;
22 (4) by displacing fossil fuels that would other23
wise be used for electricity production, nuclear power
24 plants virtually eliminate emissions of greenhouse
127
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 gases and criteria pollutants associated with acid
2 rain, smog, or ozone;
3 (5) nuclear power generation continues to re4
quire robust efforts to address issues of safety,
5 waste, and proliferation;
6 (6) even if every nuclear plant is granted a 20-
7 year extension, all currently operating nuclear plants
8 will be retired by 2055;
9 (7) long lead times for nuclear power plant con10
struction indicate that action to stimulate the nu11
clear power industry should not be delayed;
12 (8) the high upfront capital costs of nuclear
13 plant construction remain a substantial obstacle, de14
spite theoretical potential for significant cost reduc15
tion;
16 (9) translating theoretical cost reduction poten17
tial into actual reduced construction costs remains a
18 significant industry challenge that can be overcome
19 only through demonstrated performance;
20 (10) as of January 2009, 17 companies and
21 consortia have submitted applications to the Nuclear
22 Regulatory Commission for 26 new reactors in the
23 United States;
24 (11) those proposed reactors will use the latest
25 in nuclear technology for efficiency and safety, more
128
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 advanced than the technology of the 1960s and
2 1970s found in the reactors currently operating in
3 the United States;
4 (12) increased resources for the Nuclear Regu5
latory Commission and reform of the licensing proc6
ess have improved the safety and timeliness of the
7 regulatory environment;
8 (13) the United States has not built a new re9
actor since the 1970s and, as a result, will need to
10 revitalize and retool the institutions and infrastruc11
ture necessary to construct, maintain, and support
12 new reactors, including improvements in manufac13
turing of nuclear components and training for the
14 next generation nuclear workforce; and
15 (14) those new reactors will launch a new era
16 for the nuclear industry, and translate into tens of
17 thousands of jobs
18 (b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy of the
19 United States, given the importance of transitioning to a
20 clean energy, low-carbon economy, to facilitate the contin21
ued development and growth of a safe and clean nuclear
22 energy industry, through—
23 (1) reductions in financial and technical bar24
riers to construction and operation; and
129
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 (2) incentives for the development of a well2
trained workforce and the growth of safe domestic
3 nuclear and nuclear-related industries.
4 SEC. 132. NUCLEAR WORKER TRAINING.
5 (a) DEFINITION OF APPLICABLE PERIOD.—In this
6 section, the term ‘‘applicable period’’ means—
7 (1) the 5-year period beginning on January 1,
8 2012; and
9 (2) each 5-year period beginning on each Janu10
ary 1 thereafter.
11 (b) USE OF FUNDS.—Of amounts made available to
12 carry out this section for the calendar years in each appli13
cable period—
14 (1) the Secretary of Energy shall use such
15 amounts for each applicable period as the Secretary
16 of Energy determines to be necessary to increase the
17 number and amounts of nuclear science talent ex18
pansion grants and nuclear science competitiveness
19 grants provided under section 5004 of the America
20 COMPETES Act (42 U.S.C. 16532); and

20 (1) DESIGNATION AND DELEGATION.—A State
21 may designate one or more agencies or entities, in22
cluding those regulated by the State, to carry out
23 the purposes of this section, but shall designate one
24 entity or individual as the principal point of contact
25 for the Administrator regarding the REEP Pro214
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 gram. The designated State agency, agencies, or en2
tities may delegate performance of appropriate ele3
ments of the REEP program, upon their request
4 and subject to State law, to counties, municipalities,
5 appropriate public agencies, and other divisions of
6 local government, as well as to entities regulated by
7 the State. In making any such designation or delega8
tion, a State shall give priority to entities that ad9
minister existing comprehensive retrofit programs,
10 including those under the supervision of State utility
11 regulators. States shall maintain responsibility for
12 meeting the standards and requirements of the
13 REEP program. In any State that elects not to ad14
minister the REEP program, a unit of local govern15
ment may propose to do so within its jurisdiction,
16 and if the Administrator finds that such local gov17
ernment is capable of administering the program,
18 the Administrator may provide assistance to that
19 local government, prorated according to the popu20
lation of the local jurisdiction relative to the popu21
lation of the State, for purposes of the REEP pro22
gram.

1 tor-owned utilities, building auditors and inspectors,
2 contractors, nonprofit organizations, for-profit com3
panies, and other entities to perform audits and ret4
rofit services under this section. A State may pro5
vide incentives for retrofits without direct participa6
tion by the State or its agents, so long as the result7
ing savings are measured and verified. A State or
8 local administrator of a REEP program shall seek
9 to ensure that sufficient qualified entities are avail10
able to support retrofit activities so that building
11 owners have a competitive choice among qualified
12 auditors, raters, contractors, and providers of serv13
ices related to retrofits. Nothing in this section is in14
tended to deny the right of a building owner to
15 choose the specific providers of retrofit services to
16 engage for a retrofit project in that owner’s building.
17 (3) EQUAL INCENTIVES FOR EQUAL IMPROVE18
MENT.—In general, the States should strive to offer
19 the same levels of incentives for retrofits that meet
20 the same efficiency improvement goals, regardless of
21 whether the State, its agency or entity, or the build22
ing owner has conducted the retrofit achieving the
23 improvement, provided the improvement is measured
24 and verified.

22 SEC. 167. TREE PLANTING PROGRAMS.
23 (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
24 (1) the utility sector is the largest single source
25 of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States,
241
O:\DEC\DEC09781.xml [file 2 of 5] S.L.C.
1 producing approximately 1/3 of the emissions of the
2 United States;
3 (2) heating and cooling of homes accounts for
4 nearly 60 percent of residential electricity usage in
5 the United States;
6 (3) shade trees planted in strategic locations
7 can reduce residential cooling costs by as much as
8 30 percent;
9 (4) shade trees are associated with significant
10 clean air benefits;
11 (5) every group of 100 healthy large trees re12
moves approximately 300 pounds of air pollution (in13
cluding particulate matter and ozone) and approxi14
mately 15 tons of carbon dioxide from the air each
15 year;
16 (6) tree cover on private property and on newly
17 developed land has declined since the 1970s, even
18 while emissions from transportation and industry
19 have been rising; and
20 (7) in more than 12 test cities across the
21 United States, increasing urban tree cover has gen22
erated between $2 and $5 in savings for every dollar
23 invested in such tree planting.

tation, Technology, Education,
19 and Research
20 SEC. 211. EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON DRINKING
21 WATER UTILITIES.
22 (a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that—
23 (1) the consensus among climate scientists is
24 overwhelming that climate change is occurring more
25 rapidly than can be attributed to natural causes, and
267
O:\DEC\DEC09782.xml [file 3 of 5] S.L.C.
1 that significant impacts to the water supply are al2
ready occurring;
3 (2) among the first and most critical of those
4 impacts will be change to patterns of precipitation
5 around the world, which will affect water availability
6 for the most basic drinking water and domestic
7 water needs of populations in many areas of the
8 United States;
9 (3) drinking water utilities throughout the
10 United States, as well as those in Europe, Australia,
11 and Asia, are concerned that extended changes in
12 precipitation will lead to extended droughts;
13 (4) supplying water is highly energy-intensive
14 and will become more so as climate change forces
15 more utilities to turn to alternative supplies;
16 (5) energy production consumes a significant
17 percentage of the fresh water resources of the
18 United States;
19 (6) since 2003, the drinking water industry of
20 the United States has sponsored, through a non21
profit water research foundation, various studies to
22 assess the impacts of climate change on drinking
23 water supplies;
24 (7) those studies demonstrate the need for a
25 comprehensive program of research into the full
268
O:\DEC\DEC09782.xml [file 3 of 5] S.L.C.
1 range of impacts on drinking water utilities, includ2
ing impacts on water supplies, facilities, and cus3
tomers;
4 (8) that nonprofit water research foundation is
5 also coordinating internationally with other drinking
6 water utilities on shared research projects and has
7 hosted international workshops with counterpart Eu8
ropean and Asian water research organizations to
9 develop a unified research agenda for applied re10
search on adaptive strategies to address climate
11 change impacts;
12 (9) research data in existence as of the date of
13 enactment of this Act—
14 (A) summarize the best available scientific
15 evidence on climate change;
16 (B) identify the implications of climate
17 change for the water cycle and the availability
18 and quality of water resources; and
19 (C) provide general guidance on planning
20 and adaptation strategies for water utilities;
21 and
22 (10) given uncertainties about specific climate
23 changes in particular areas, drinking water utilities
24 need to prepare for a wider range of likely possibili25
ties in managing and delivery of water.

3 ‘‘(2) TERM OFFSET CREDITS.—
4 ‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Covered entities may,
5 in accordance with this paragraph, use non-ex6
pired term offset credits instead of domestic
7 offset credits for purposes of temporarily dem8
onstrating compliance with this section.

10 term offset credits and domestic offset credits
11 used by a covered entity to demonstrate compli12
ance for its emissions or attributable green13
house gas emissions in any given year shall not
14 exceed the quantity of domestic offset credits

1 ‘‘(F) FINANCIAL ASSURANCE.—A covered
2 entity may not use a term offset credit to dem3
onstrate compliance temporarily unless it simul4
taneously provides to the Administrator finan5
cial assurance that, at the end of the term off6
set credit‘s crediting term, the covered entity
7 will have sufficient resources to obtain the
8 quantity of allowances or credits necessary to
9 demonstrate final compliance. The Adminis10
trator shall issue regulations establishing re11
quirements for such financial assurance, which
12 shall take into account the increased risk asso13
ciated with longer crediting terms. These regu14
lations shall take into account the total number
15 of tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of green16
house gas emissions for which a covered entity
17 is demonstrating compliance temporarily, and
18 may set a limit on this amount. In the event
19 that a covered entity that used term offset cred20
its to demonstrate compliance temporarily fails
21 to meet the requirements of subparagraph (D)
22 at the end of the term offset credits’ crediting
23 term, if the financial assurance mechanism fails
24 to provide to the Administrator the number of
25 allowances or offset credits for which the cred520

2 shall retire that number of allowances with the
3 vintage year 2 years after the year in which the
4 term offset credit expires in the same amount.
5 Allowances so retired shall not be counted as
6 emission allowances established for that cal7
endar year under section 721(a).
8 ‘‘(3) INTERNATIONAL EMISSION ALLOW9
ANCES.—To demonstrate compliance, a covered enti10
ty may hold an international emission allowance in
11 lieu of an emission allowance, except as modified
12 under section 728(d).
13 ‘‘(4) COMPENSATORY ALLOWANCES.—To dem14
onstrate compliance, a covered entity may hold a
15 compensatory allowance obtained under section
16 721(f) in lieu of an emission allowance.
17 ‘‘(e) RETIREMENT OF ALLOWANCES AND CREDITS.—
18 As soon as practicable after a deadline established for cov19
ered entities to demonstrate compliance with this title, the
20 Administrator shall retire the quantity of allowances or
21 credits required to be held under this title.
22 ‘‘(f) ALTERNATIVE METRICS.—For categories of cov23
ered entities described in subparagraph (B), (C), (D), (G),
24 (H), or (I) of section 700(13), the Administrator may, by
25 rule, establish an applicability threshold for inclusion
521

5 ‘‘(g) THRESHOLD REVIEW.—For each category of
6 covered entities described in subparagraph (B), (C), (D),
7 (G), (H), or (I) of section 700(13), the Administrator
8 shall, in 2020 and once every 8 years thereafter, review
9 the carbon dioxide equivalent emission thresholds that are
10 used to define covered entities. After consideration of—
11 ‘‘(1) emissions from covered entities in each
12 such category, and from other entities of the same
13 type that emit less than the threshold amount for
14 the category (including emission sources that com15
mence operation after the date of enactment of this
16 title that are not covered entities); and
17 ‘‘(2) whether greater greenhouse gas emission
18 reductions can be cost-effectively achieved by low19
ering the applicable threshold,
20 the Administrator may by rule lower such threshold to not
21 less than 10,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emis22
sions. In determining the cost effectiveness of potential re23
ductions from lowering the threshold for covered entities,
24 the Administrator shall consider alternative regulatory

6 credits or receiving allowances or credits from the Admin7
istrator under this title, select a designated representative.
8 ‘‘(i) EDUCATION AND OUTREACH.—
9 ‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator shall es10
tablish and carry out a program of education and
11 outreach to assist covered entities, especially entities
12 having little experience with environmental regu13
latory requirements similar or comparable to those
14 under this title, in preparing to meet the compliance
15 obligations of this title. Such program shall include
16 education with respect to using markets to effec17
tively achieve such compliance.
18 ‘‘(2) FAILURE TO RECEIVE INFORMATION.—A
19 failure to receive information or assistance under
20 this subsection may not be used as a defense against
21 an allegation of any violation of this title.
22 ‘‘(j) ADJUSTMENT OF DEADLINE.—The Adminis23
trator may, by rule, establish a deadline for demonstrating

erage retail natural gas deliveries for 2006 through
3 2008, unless the owner or operator of the company
4 selects 3 other consecutive years between 1999 and
5 2008, inclusive, and timely notifies the Adminis6
trator of its selection.
7 ‘‘(2) UPDATING.—Prior to distributing 2019
8 vintage emission allowances and at 3-year intervals
9 thereafter, the Administrator shall update the dis10
tribution formula under this subsection to reflect
11 changes in each natural gas local distribution com12
pany’s service territory since the most recent for13

tribution company shall not use the value of emis23
sion allowances distributed under this section to pro24
vide to any ratepayer a rebate that is based solely
25 on the quantity of natural gas delivered to such
714
O:\DEC\DEC09784.xml [file 5 of 5] S.L.C.

7 months after the date of enactment of this title, the Ad8
ministrator, in consultation with other agencies, as appro9
priate, shall promulgate regulations governing the auction
10 of allowances under this section. Such regulations shall in11
clude the following requirements:
12 ‘‘(1) FREQUENCY; FIRST AUCTION.—Auctions
13 shall be held four times per year at regular intervals,
14 with the first auction to be held no later than March
15 31, 2011.

TURE VINTAGES.—The Administrator shall, at each
18 quarterly auction under this section, offer for sale
19 both a portion of the allowances with the same vin20
tage year as the year in which the auction is being
21 conducted and a portion of the allowances with vin22
tage years from future years. The preceding sen23
tence shall not apply to auctions held before 2012,
24 during which period, by necessity, the Administrator
25 shall auction only allowances with a vintage year
26 that is later than the year in which the auction is

stance’s carbon dioxide equivalent value, ozone
12 depletion potential, prevalence in banks in the
13 United States, and emission rates, as well as
14 the need for additional cost containment under
15 the class II, group II limits and the integrity of
16 the class II, group II limits. The Administrator
17 shall not add a class I or class II, group I sub18
stance to the list if the consumption of the sub19
